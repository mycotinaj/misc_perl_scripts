# Tips for installing ESOM


# I'm sorry if you're reading this.

# FAQ:
# How do I open this?
# After installation, run ~/ESOM/bin/esomana

# Memory error?
# Edit the java heap space in ~/ESOM/bin/esomstart

# The program runs but there is no GUI
# I recommend installing JDK 1.5 for this. You can find the link here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-javase5-downloads.html
# Be sure to install ESOM using this version of java.
# Edit ~/ESOM/bin/esomstart to use the path to this version of java instead
